    "body": "@Karayel i'm using `express-fileupload` which wraps busboy and stores files in memory at `req.files` object. thus avoid writing to the disk for what will be ultimately deleted anyway. The documentation of cloudinary states:\r\n```\r\nThe following command uploads a local file to Cloudinary:\r\n\r\ncloudinary.uploader.upload(\"my_picture.jpg\", function(result) { \r\n  console.log(result) \r\n});\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can a specify a local path, a public HTTP URL, an S3 URL, an IO stream or an actual image file's data.\r\n```\r\nat the following page:\r\nhttp://cloudinary.com/documentation/node_integration#upload_images\r\n\r\nSo, how do i do as it describes there, and upload the actual file data, which is what i have stored already in the buffer... perhaps you can pass me to someone who knows about this package?",

    "body": "Hey @roeeba ,\r\nthanks for the comment\r\n\r\nHere's some stuff I had to go through\r\n\r\nhttps://cloudinary.com/documentation/node_image_upload#server_side_upload\r\n\r\ncloudinary.v2.uploader.upload_stream : How to set options? Such as as {public_id} ?\r\nCouldn't find anywhere, had to go to the source code and find my self\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://cloudinary.com/documentation/node_image_upload#direct_uploading_from_the_browser\r\nDirect upload from the browser?\r\nisn't that nodejs docs? confusing (browser != nodejs) + many jquery examples, what?\r\n\r\nso there's a reference to the upload docs:\r\n\r\nhttps://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_upload_api_reference#upload\r\n\r\n> Parameter  = File\r\n> Type = String\r\n> Description:\r\n> 1. a local file path (supported in SDKs only)\r\n> 2. the actual data (byte array buffer). \r\n> 3. For example, in some SDKs, this could be an IO input stream of the data (e.g., File.open(file, \"rb\")).\r\n> 4. the Data URI (Base64 encoded), max ~60MB (62,910,000 chars)\r\n> 5. the remote FTP, HTTP or HTTPS URL address of an existing file\r\n> an S3 URL of a whitelisted bucket\r\n> \r\n\r\n2 and 4 doesn't work on the nodejs sdk and the nodejs docs refer to that.\r\nHow am I suppose to guess it? why is it documented then? and isn't that very basic thing to allow upload a Buffer? all the nodejs binary data works with buffers, isn't that basic? it only works with uploading a file with a given path to file but\r\nIf I already have the file stored on my server, then why do I need cloudinary?\r\nand I guess that your nodejs sdk anyway reads the file as a buffer\r\n\r\nMight be very helpful if:\r\n1. support typescript definition\r\n2. write documentation such as jsdoc  \r\n    Example for amazing documentation\r\n    https://draftjs.org/docs/api-reference-content-state.html#content\r\n    Describes all the options in one place with some examples, at cloudinary the docs are just few examples.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo currently I find my self doing\r\n`console.log(cloudinary)`\r\nand getting a huge list  to some how reverse the SDK and understand alone how to use the SDK\r\n ```\r\n  uploader:\r\n      { unsigned_upload_stream: [Function],\r\n        upload_stream: [Function],\r\n        unsigned_upload: [Function],\r\n        upload: [Function],\r\n        upload_large_part: [Function],\r\n        upload_large: [Function],\r\n        upload_chunked: [Function],\r\n        upload_chunked_stream: [Function],\r\n        explicit: [Function],\r\n        destroy: [Function],\r\n        rename: [Function],\r\n        text: [Function],\r\n        generate_sprite: [Function],\r\n        multi: [Function],\r\n        explode: [Function],\r\n        add_tag: [Function],\r\n        remove_tag: [Function],\r\n        remove_all_tags: [Function],\r\n        add_context: [Function],\r\n        remove_all_context: [Function],\r\n        replace_tag: [Function],\r\n        create_archive: [Function],\r\n        create_zip: [Function],\r\n        direct_upload: [Function],\r\n        upload_tag_params: [Function],\r\n        upload_url: [Function],\r\n        image_upload_tag: [Function],\r\n        unsigned_image_upload_tag: [Function] },\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich might be helpful if it was documented somewhere\r\n(couldn't find reference to most of it at any place)\r\n\r\nFor typescript, I've noticed that cloudinary-core does support typings\r\nhttps://github.com/cloudinary/pkg-cloudinary-core\r\nbut as written at the example on the github:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar cl = cloudinary.Cloudinary.new();\r\ncl.fromEnvironment();\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen trying that (EXACTLY as written at the docs) \r\n```\r\nvar cl = cloudinary.Cloudinary.new();\r\ncl.fromEnvironment(); \r\n```\r\nI get typescript error\r\n\r\n> **Property fromEnvironment does not exist on type 'Cloudinary'.**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was really depressing\r\nI really want to use the Cloudinary product and I find it really good, few years ago I used it\r\nwith the IOS sdk and it took me something like 1 hour until there was\r\nimages at the cloud. Now it took me more than half day when using the javascript sdk\r\nbecause it is just not documented\r\n\r\nTried also direct upload from the browser but I didn't want that as solution and we're using React\r\nwhich makes some stuff harder\r\n\r\nI did see cloudinary React\r\nhttps://github.com/cloudinary/cloudinary-react\r\nwhich isn't mentioned at all on the cloudinary website\r\nand isn't documented at all and the docs link doesn't have React at the list\r\n\r\n\r\n",

However, buffers do not have a filename, so by default it assigns `file` as filename:\r\nhttps://github.com/cloudinary/cloudinary_npm/blob/c6aa42b11f2b0b97d904f93d2c5794da8c0cdb1b/src/uploader.coffee#L279\r\nThe solution is pretty simple, it could check if `options.file` is defined, if not then assign `file` as filename.\r\n\r\nEdit: This PR fixes the problem: https://github.com/cloudinary/cloudinary_npm/pull/176",
